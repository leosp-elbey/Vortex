# VortexTrips — Current Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-04-30
**Last known good commit:** `869e1b6` — "fix(cron): images on auto-content + SEO files"
**Production:** vortextrips.com (deployed via `npx vercel --prod` on 2026-04-30)
**Branch:** `main`

---

## ⚠️ HARD RULE — READ FIRST

**No phase is considered complete until:**
1. `PROJECT_STATE_CURRENT.md` is updated
2. `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` is updated
3. All changes are committed
4. `git push origin main` confirms "Everything up-to-date"

If any of those four steps is missing, the phase is **NOT done** — regardless of how working the code looks.

See `SAVE_PROTOCOL.md` for the full workflow.

## Current completed phase

**Phases 0 through 11 — SHIPPED.** System is LIVE on vortextrips.com.

- Phases 0-10 in `ad42f44` (AI Command Center, security, HeyGen async)
- Phase 10.5 in `f2b41e6` (save protocol + image safety guard)
- Phase 11 deploy hotfix in `8e54262` (env var whitespace trim — prevented OpenRouter 401 errors caused by tabs/spaces in pasted env values)

This includes:
- Phase 0 — Audit & plan
- Phase 1 — All 11 database migrations (`supabase/migrations/006`–`016`)
- Phase 2 — Env vars (`.env.example` updated)
- Phase 3 — AI Router (`src/lib/ai-router.ts`, `src/lib/ai-models.ts`)
- Phase 4 — Claude verifier (`src/lib/ai-verifier.ts`)
- Phase 5 — 12 admin AI API routes under `src/app/api/ai/`
- Phase 6 — AI Command Center dashboard (`src/app/dashboard/ai-command-center/page.tsx` + 5 components in `src/components/ai/`)
- Phase 7 — Workflow generators (social-pack, video-script, email-sequence, blog, social-calendar)
- Phase 8 — Webhook security hardening (`src/lib/webhook-auth.ts`, `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`)
- Phase 9 — HeyGen async cron (`src/app/api/cron/check-heygen-jobs/route.ts`)
- Phase 10 — Build/typecheck/lint verification

## Files created/edited in the latest session (Phase 11)

**Created:**
- `src/app/api/admin/env-check/route.ts` — admin-only diagnostic showing env var presence, length, and prefix (no values exposed). Was instrumental in finding the whitespace bug.

**Edited:**
- `src/lib/ai-router.ts` — all `process.env.X` reads now go through `envTrim()` helper that strips leading/trailing whitespace
- `src/lib/ai-verifier.ts` — same trim treatment, plus explicit `apiKey` passed to Anthropic client
- `PROJECT_STATE_CURRENT.md` + `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` — Phase 11 complete

**Deployed:**
- Preview chain: `vortex-el75d800f` → `vortex-9soz0ntmi` → `vortex-ik4zkym1a` → `vortex-bczpnbclr` → `vortex-cfb100glz` (the one that worked)
- Production: `dpl_qDc73T2dNmEmtQZPajwZpdAW6R6H` → vortextrips.com

## What is working in production (validated end-to-end)

- ✅ AI Command Center page renders at vortextrips.com/dashboard/ai-command-center
- ✅ AI generation: tested via "Verifier test" job — llama-3.3-70b-instruct, cost $0.0001, output rendered correctly
- ✅ Claude verification: tested same job — Opus 4.7 returned approved/92, all 6 brand checks passed, caught real issues (malformed hashtag, missing brand mention) → confirms verifier is doing real quality review, not rubber-stamping
- ✅ Sidebar nav link at `src/components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx:14`
- ✅ All AI API routes admin-gated via `src/lib/admin-auth.ts`
- ✅ Webhook signature checks live on Bland, Twilio, HeyGen
- ✅ Rate limiting on AI generation endpoints
- ✅ HeyGen async pattern shipped (no more 10s timeouts)
- ✅ Env var whitespace defense (trim on every read)
- ✅ `ai_jobs`, `ai_verification_logs`, `ai_model_usage` tables all writing correctly

## Post-launch follow-ups (not blockers)

- **Code lint config:** `next lint` was removed in Next.js 16. The `lint` script in package.json is broken. Fix: install ESLint v9 + `eslint-config-next` flat config, or remove the lint script. Typecheck and build are the real gates and both pass.
- **Vercel "Needs Attention" flags** on Supabase env vars: cosmetic, not blocking. Refresh via the Supabase integration UI when convenient.
- **Whitespace cleanup in Vercel env vars:** the trim fix means tabs/spaces in env values are now harmless, but it's still good hygiene to delete and re-paste OPENROUTER_BASE_URL, AI_MEDIUM_MODEL, OPENROUTER_API_KEY without leading whitespace. Do this on a slow day.
- **Verify Claude verification flow** end-to-end (click "Verify with Claude" on a real job and confirm `ai_verification_logs` row appears).
- **HeyGen lifelike upgrades** (post-launch quality): ElevenLabs voice clone, Studio Avatar, b-roll cutaways. See chat history.
- **Per-platform image/video sizing** (`src/lib/social-specs.ts`). 2-3 hours, post-launch enhancement.

## Known issues

- Previous Claude chat froze due to images >2000px being pasted/dragged in. The image safety guard added this session is the fix; from now on, screenshots must be ≤2000px on the longest side. See `IMAGE_UPLOAD_RULES.md`.
- `package.json` has no `typecheck` script — use `npx tsc --noEmit` instead.
- Vercel Hobby plan: 10s function timeout, daily cron only, max 4 cron jobs total. We are at the limit (score-and-branch, send-sequences, weekly-content, check-heygen-jobs).

## Exact next step

**Phase 11 is complete. System is live.** No urgent next step — pick from the post-launch follow-ups above based on priority.

Recommended Phase 12 candidates (in priority order):
1. Smoke-test "Verify with Claude" on a real job (5 minutes, just click the button)
2. Build social-specs.ts for per-platform sizing (2-3 hours)
3. ElevenLabs voice clone for HeyGen videos (half day)
4. Custom HeyGen Studio Avatar trained on Leo's face (1-2 days)
